====================

This idea behind these application examples have been taken from "Net-Tutsplus". So the credit goes to Nettuts website 
which provided the backbone application example.

You can have a look <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/build-a-contacts-manager-using-backbone-js-part-1/" target="_blank">here</a>.

The goal of this directory is to provide the basic understanding of the working application of Backbone.JS Application.
