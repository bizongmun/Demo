/*
	The goal of this file is to provide Backbone Model, Collection, Views & Routers.
	This is where your application begins.
	
	Currently we are not using any AMD like require.js so we need to include all 
	the things in this file.

	You should customize it in order to use your views, models, collections and routers.
